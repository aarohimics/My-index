        <p>We are Aarohi and Nishi we started Rock It Reading because we loved to read and loved art so we decided to make bookmarks. We started making bookmarks a few years ago and have been making them ever since.</p>
        <p>I am Aarohi Pulipati I am a rising 6th grader. I love to swim and go 
          on airplanes. I am a resident of Mount Holly, North Carolina. Some of 
          my hobbies are art, reading, watching bollywood movies, and robotics. 
          My favorite movies are <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330373/">Harry Potter Goblet Of Fire </a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12844910/">Pathaan</a>. 
          I enjoy doing outdoor activities with my dad. I also love making 
          bookmarks with my mom. At school my favorite subjects are math and 
          reading. I occassionally enjoy difficult lego projects and coding on
           <a href="https://edabit.com/">edabit</a>. My recent travels and trips were to Europe - we visited Amsterdam, Strasburg, Brussels, Paris, Touslouse, and Spain, Universal Studios Florida, the 
           Mountains and the family favorite - Topsail Beach.</p>
