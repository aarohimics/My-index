        <p>Rock it Reading is a bookmark company that produces handmade bookmarks. It is run by two young friends with big imaginations. The company was born during the Covid-19 quarantine. The girls started making bookmarks because it encouraged them to read more and brought them closer together. We asked the girls why they felt Rock It Reading was unique, they said “We feel our company is unique because we put energy into each of our bookmarks to make sure they all are fit for use”. They think Rock It Reading is the best company to purchase bookmarks from because they are all handmade and the company ensures that the customers are satisfied.
